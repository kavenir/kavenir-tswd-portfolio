## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

After the three interviews and the additional critique in during class (10/03), the audience for my final data story are residents of Chicago, those who are enviornmentally concious (can be from anywhere), and those with an passion for public policy. After conducting the interviews, I was able to feel the sense of geniune engagement and interest from Interviewee A, a past resident of Chicago, and Interviewee B, a student who is enviornmentally concious as compared to the Interviewee C, who was indifferent about the issue. Althought I knew I wanted the main target audience to be those from Chicago, Interviewee B, and my classmates who are from public policy programs expressed their genuine interest in the topic because of their environmental awareness and because when I brought up the policy from the 1930s of discrimination redlining in Chicago, they said "a light clicked/turned on in their mind" that made them realize why this issue matters. 

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.
