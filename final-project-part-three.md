## The audience

After the three interviews and the additional critique in during class (10/03), the audience for my final data story are residents of Chicago, those who are enviornmentally concious (can be from anywhere), and those with an passion for public policy. After conducting the interviews, I was able to feel the sense of geniune engagement and interest from Interviewee A, a past resident of Chicago, and Interviewee B, a student who is enviornmentally concious as compared to the Interviewee C, who was indifferent about the issue. Althought I knew I wanted the main target audience to be those from Chicago, Interviewee B, and my classmates who are from public policy programs expressed their genuine interest in the topic because of their environmental awareness and because when I brought up the policy from the 1930s of discrimination redlining in Chicago, they said "a light clicked/turned on in their mind" that made them realize why this issue matters. To make the story work for my target audience, I resorted the slides to have the problem address in the beginning rather than the end so that they really could get a sense of the history and policy of the issue. For example, before I had the redlining context and reality context slides more towards the end of the presentation, but I decided to move them to the beginning after the overview and benefits to really bring to attention the issue at hand and have the "light click" earlier in the audience's mind. Additionally, on the redlining section, I added a button that the audience can click on to to learn more about hte Chicago Tribune's study and how redlining has impacted tree canopy and tree equity in Chicago. Finally, instead of just providing references for Chicago at the end, I provided an additional resource that will allow them to look at tree equity and tree canopy for the city or state of their choice.

## Final thoughts

I really enjoyed working on this final project because it is an issue that I am passionate about and have done research for in the past. Because I had the context for the issue from my previous research, most of my time was spent finding data, creating visualizations, and then creating a storyline that is easily understandable and inutitive for the audience to understand. I believe I had a sufficent amount of time, but if I were to continue this project, I would like to look more into if there are any metrics from the Our Roots Chicago initiave that show the value and impact they have made so far with their implementation of the program. Additionally, I was only able to find a study that showed the how trees are connected with overall health and wellbeing, but if I had more time, I would have tried to find a study that was specific to Chicago and actually compared health status among the populations of different neighborhoods. I think my favorite part of the whole project was conducting a user research protocol because it was not only helpful in gaining insightful feedback, but I enjoyed seeing the reactions of my interviewees as they went through my storyline. When I first introduced the topic to them, they did not really know what equitable tree canopy was, and I was worried they were going to not be engaged and feel not interested in the topic. As I let them scroll through they shorthand, I liked hearing their reactions, such as "wow", "I did not know that", and "that is interesting", and then at the end, Interviewee A, who was a past resident of Chicago, said that she is definitely going to pay more attention to the trees in the neighborhoods whenever she comes back to Chicago to visit. The user interviews really helped me gain valuable feedback and expanded my perspective to how people from different backgrounds might view the story. As I was making the changes from the user interviews for the final deliverable, I was able to understand why they gave that piece of feedback and its importance. Finally, I liked using shorthand, although it took a while to figure out at first, since it is tool to add to my "tool kit" that I can use for future presentations. Overall, since I am interested in a career in data analytics and data science, I know this whole project process will be invaluable in my future career.
