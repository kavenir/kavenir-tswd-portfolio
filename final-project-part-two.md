# Part II, Final project wireframes / storyboards and user research

## Wireframes / storyboards
To further develop my story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards, I decided to directly use Shorthand to get a jump start of the final deliverable and thought it would the best way to recieve the most critical and impactful feedback during my interviews. 

My story outline draft using Shorthand can be viewed below. 

## User research protocol

### Target audience

My intended **target audience** are those who live in the City of Chicago and the surrounding areas as the issue of tree equity and tree canopy are being brought to light more in regards to how trees have been strategically planted in wealthier more affluent neigborhoods instead of distributed equally throughout the city. Although people of Chicago are my intended audience, I also want my story to reach the general public because not only is it an issue in Chicago, but it exists the across the United States. I hope learning more about the issue in Chicago would motivate them to learn more about tree equity and tree canopy in their city.

To **indentify representative individuals to interview** based on my intended target audience, I considered three types of individuals: one person that has lived in Chicago and has noticed the issue firsthand, one person who environmentally conscious (cares about the enviornment), and one who is neutral, meaning they have no prior knowlegde about tree canopy or tree equity and see to be indifferent about the enviornment. I also tried to make sure they have had prior experience/knowledge in creating data visualizations so they could provide some useful feedback on my visualizations to ensure they are clear and understandable. The information on my interviewees are as follows: 

- **Interviewee A.** Female (mid-30s) with a business and logistics background who lived in Northern Chicago for 6 years. 
- **Interviewee B.** Male (early-30s) with an information technology, policy, and data analytics background who is enviornmentally concious due to previous enviornmental experiences within his hometown in India. 
- **Interviewee C.** Male (early-20s) with a biomedical engineering and physics background with no prior knowledge of tree equity or tree canopy.
