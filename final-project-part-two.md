# Part II, Final project wireframes / storyboards and user research

## Wireframes / storyboards
To further develop my story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards, I decided to directly use Shorthand to get a jump start of the final deliverable and thought it would the best way to recieve the most critical and impactful feedback during my interviews. 

My story outline draft using Shorthand can be viewed below:

## User research protocol

### Target audience

My intended **target audience** are those who live in the City of Chicago and the surrounding areas as the issue of tree equity and tree canopy are being brought to light more in regards to how trees have been strategically planted in wealthier more affluent neigborhoods instead of distributed equally throughout the city. Although people of Chicago are my intended audience, I also want my story to reach the general public because not only is it an issue in Chicago, but it exists the across the United States. I hope learning more about the issue in Chicago would motivate them to learn more about tree equity and tree canopy in their city.

To **indentify representative individuals to interview** based on my intended target audience, I considered three types of individuals: one person that has lived in Chicago and has noticed the issue firsthand, one person who environmentally conscious (cares about the enviornment), and one who is neutral, meaning they have no prior knowlegde about tree canopy or tree equity and see to be indifferent about the enviornment. I also tried to make sure they have had prior experience/knowledge in creating data visualizations so they could provide some useful feedback on my visualizations to ensure they are clear and understandable. The information on my interviewees are as follows: 

- **Interviewee A.** Female (mid-30s) with a business and logistics background who lived in Northern Chicago for 6 years. 
- **Interviewee B.** Male (early-30s) with an information technology, policy, and data analytics background who is enviornmentally concious due to previous enviornmental experiences within his hometown in India. 
- **Interviewee C.** Male (early-20s) with a biomedical engineering and physics background with little prior knowledge of tree equity or tree canopy and is indifferent about the issue. 

### Interview script
In designing my Interview Script, I focused on three main areas (2 of which are from the GoodCharts Critque Method, 1 from GoodCharts Chapter 7):
- Design Exection (Asthetics, Layout of Shorthand, and Types of Visualizations)
- Contextual Awareness (Clarity, Simplicity, Intuitiveness)
- Persuasion and Manipulation (Motivation, Engagement, Learning Experience) 
- General Question

| Goal                                             | Question(s) to Ask                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Design Execution: Asthetics                      | Are there any elements that are distracting or confusing such as layout, color, text, font?                                                  |
| Design Execution: Layout of Shorthand            | Does the chosen layout of Shorthand make the story flow well?                                                                                |
| Design Execution: Types of Visualizations        | Are the visualizations used appropriate for the data used? Are they clear? Confusing? Misleading?                                            |
| Contextual Awareness: Clarity                    | Is the overall story and objective clear? Is there anything you think needs to be clarifed more?                                             |
| Contextual Awareness: Simplicity                 | Is the story easy to follow, or were there places that were more difficult to understand than others?                                        |
| Contextual Awareness: Inutitiveness              | Is the story inuitive and clear? Are there any improvements that need to be made to the storyboard? Additional information needed?           |
| Persuasion and Manipulation: Motivation          | Do you feel motivated to learn more about tree equity or tree canopy in Chicago or your place of choice?                                     |
| Persuasion and Manipulation: Engagement          | While looking through the storyboard/wireframe, did you stay engaged throughout or were there places where you began to become uninterested? |
| Persuasion and Manipulation: Learning Experience | Did you learn anything? Is there something else you wish/hoped to learn after viewing the whole storyboard?                                  |
| Overall: Final Recommendations/Thoughts          | Overall, is there anything you would change or do differently? Any final thoughts or recommendations?                                        |


### Interview findings
The interviews with Interviewee A and B were conducted virtually while Interviewee C was interviewed in person. During the interview, I gave interviewees 5 minutes to control of my storyboard/wireframe, where they could scroll through Shorthand as much as they needed within the alloted time. If they needed more time, I gave them a few more minutes and ask if they were ready to proceed with the questions. 

Details of the findings from my interviews are shared and summarized below:

| Question(s) Asked                                                                                                                               | Interviewee A  | Interviewee B  | Interviewee C |

## Identified changes for Part III

The feedback from the interviewees will be reflected in my final deliverable to address any issues identified. Conducting a user research protocol not only helpful in gaining insightful feedback, but also helped expand my lense to view the storyboard and wireframes from a different perspectives. 

Although I will try to implement all of the feedback from the interviewees, the most essential changes that will be implemented next week in my final deliverable from my user research protcol is shared and summarized below: 

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Findings or observations from interviews | Describe what, if any changes you anticipate making to address the observation. |
|                                          |                                                                                 |
|                                          |                                                                                 |
|                                          |                                                                                 |
| ...add more rows as necessary            |                                                                                 |

Additionally, I need to make sure to add references/citations for some of the images used. I also used additional data to create some of the visualzations, so I need to make sure to cite those as well. All contextual information should already be cited correctly, but I plan to go through everything again to double check.
