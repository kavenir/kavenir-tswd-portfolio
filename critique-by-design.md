# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design
The purpose of this assignment is to complete a workflow that is similar to the final project where we are tasked to find a visualization that needs improvement, critque it using Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf), sketch possible solutions, share the skecthes with at least two people to get their feedback, and finally take the feedback you've received on your proposed solution, modify your design and then build a solution (using Flourish or Tableau). 

## Step one: find a data visualization (with data you can use!)
For this assignment, I used this data visualization, [Charting the 20 Top Growing U.S. Careers Based on Real Salary Projections](https://howmuch.net/articles/fastest-growing-occupations-in-the-US), from howmuch.net. This visualization is based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics regarding projected salary information on the top 20 fastest growing careers in median salary from 2019-2029. I chose this particular visualization because the layout stood out to me since it was something that I was not familiar with and since the job market is always a topic of interest especially for those that are deciding what career field they want to enter or those that are looking for a career change. As I looked at the visualization more and read the article more in depth, I realized that the story they are trying to tell is very simple, but the visualization provided can mislead the audience without careful analysis and makes harder to understand and interpret the overall story.

## Step two: critique the data visualization

## Step three: sketch out a solution

## Step four: test the solution 

## Step five: build your solution
