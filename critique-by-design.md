# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design
The purpose of this assignment is to complete a workflow that is similar to the final project where we are tasked to find a visualization that needs improvement, critque it using Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf), sketch possible solutions, share the skecthes with at least two people to get their feedback, and finally take the feedback you've received on your proposed solution, modify your design and then build a solution (using Flourish or Tableau). 

## Step one: find a data visualization (with data you can use!)
For this assignment, I used this data visualization, [Charting the 20 Top Growing U.S. Careers Based on Real Salary Projections](https://howmuch.net/articles/fastest-growing-occupations-in-the-US), from howmuch.net. This visualization is based on data from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) regarding projected salary information in the next coming decade on the top 20 fastest growing careers in median salary in 2019. I chose this particular visualization because the type of visualization stood out to me since it was something that I was not familiar with, and since the job market is usually a topic of interest especially for those that are deciding what career field they want to enter or those that are looking for a career change. As I analyzed at the visualization more and read the article in depth, I realized that the story they are trying to tell is very simple, but the visualization used makes the story seem more complex, can mislead the audience without careful analysis, and there are several elements (which will be discussed later) that make the story harder to understand. The data was not available anymore on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics since it is from 2019, and they update this data every year, but a data table with occupation, 2019 median pay (yearly), and growth rate (2019-2029) was provided on the howmuch.net website, but I was able to extract the 2029 projected median pay (yearly) from the visualization and create an excel file with the data.

## Step three: sketch out a solution
After critiquing the visualization, I had three ideas in mind on how to redesign the visualization: a grouped bar chart, a slope chart, and a simple bar chart. I used flourish to create these sketches. 

Although the original visualization wanted to focus on providing the audience with information on the occupations salary in 2019, their projected salary in 2029, and the growth rate all within the visualization, I decided to change the story was just focus on the projected growth rate of the occupation and highlight the one with the highest value. Additionally, I wanted to focus on creating a title was clear and and described the story well, show that wind turbine service technicans had the highest projcected growth rate despite them not having the highest paying median salary in 2019, reduce the number of colors, and change the type of visualization that fit the data and story better. 

In the first two sketches, the grouped bar chart and slope chart, I tried to include all the information of 2019 salary, 2029 projected salary, and growth rate, but including that information, you are not able to clearly see that wind service teachnicians have the highest growth rate in salary because the bars and slope are based upon their salaries. Therfore the occupations that have a higher salary have larger bars, and steeper slopes. I still wanted to retain the the information on the salaries, and I realized that flourish and tableau offer an interactive compenent that allows you to add additonal information that may not be captured within the visualization. 

This is what lead me to my third sketch, which was my best propesed solution, the simple bar chart. Using a simple barchart, I was able to clearly show that wind turbine service teachnicans are projected to have the highest growth rate in yearly median salary by 2029 by coloring the bar green and making the other bars grey. Adding the labels on each bars so the audience could clearly know the value of the growth rate for the occupation helps the audience differentiate the occupations. I also added a clearer title and axis labels that indicates that this chart is about a growth in median salary, but not in number of people in the occupation which was not transparent in the previous title or provided legend. Since the bars only showed the growth rate, I made sure that when you hover your cursor over a bar, you should be able to see the associated salary information so the audience has it if they are interested. My only gripe with this visualization was that it was long vertically so you had to scroll up and down to see all the occupations listed, but overall I believed the visualization already improved significantly.

## Step four: test the solution 
To test my proposed solution, I asked **7 questions** to my participants to capture specific feedback on the simple bar chart I created: 
- **1. Can you describe to me what you think this visualization is about?**
- **2. Is there anything you find surprising? Confusing? Misleading? Hard to interpret?**
- **3. Who do you think is the intended audience?**
- **4. Is the visualization interesting/does it grab your attention? Or are there stylistic changes that need to be considered such as color, text, etc?**
- **5. Is the visualization easy to understand with minimal effort and well communicated?**
- **6. Is all the data included necessary? Is there anything that should be removed or added?**
- **7. Overall, is there anything you would change or do differently?**

I asked for feedback from two female students in their mid 20's, and they both offered feedback that was very helpful in finalizing my solution. Both students were able to interpret the purpose of the visualization with minimal effort based on the clear title, the occupation with the highest growth rate (wind turbine service technicians) was colored green, and simple bar charts are relatively easy to interpret. They were both surprised of the occupation with the highest growth rate, but student 1 identified that it was a little hard to differentiate the occupations since she had to scroll up and down many times to view all the different occupations. On the other hand, student 2 thought the growth rate as percentage could be misleading to certain audiences because people could think that occupations with the highest growth rate could also have the highest paying salary, but in reality, the salaries of the occupations have different levels. They both identified that the intended audience are people interested in chosing their careers paths such as students between their final year of high school or second year of college, but student 2 offered an interesting perspective that people who are planning to switch careers would also be interested. Asthetically, they thought the colors were fine (especially the green vs. grey contrast) and put the bars in descending order was helpful, but student 1 suggested to make the text darker to just all black instead of dark grey, and student 2 recommended adding a percent (%) symbol on the bar labels to make it more intutive because otherwise the audience would have the scroll to the axis to know it is a percentage. Although they both identified that all the data in the bar chart is necessary, they both suggested that adding a career category would help the audience be able to differentiate the occupations, but when looking at the occupations individually, they noticed overlap based on the career fields. I was surprised they both were able to think of this because this idea did not even come up in my mind. This recommendation was most essential in helping me design my final solution. This step was very not only helpful in gaining feedback, but also helped expand my lense to view the visualization from a different perspective.  

## Step five: build your solution
