Hi! My name is Katelin Lauren Avenir, and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a second year graduate student in the Master's of Health Care Analytics and Information Technology (MSHCA) Program at Heinz College of Carnegie Mellon University. I was born and raised in suburb just north of Chicago, Illinois, but my parents are originally from the Philippines. 

I earned my bachelor's degree from John Carroll University located in Cleveland, Ohio where I studied Data Science and Spanish. I was a member of the Varsity Swimming and Diving team for three years. Upon graduating, I took on my first full-time position as a Clinical Research Business Development Liaison at University Hospitals where I soon transitioned into a Data Scientist role working on patient enrollment and recuritment for clinical trials. Soon after, I decided to pursue my master's degree at Heinz College because it was the perfect opporutnity to further my data science skills, but also to learn and explore other disciplines that Heinz College offered with their comprehensive and wholisitic curriculum. 

# What I hope to learn
Overall, in this course, Telling Stories with Data, I am excited to look at data creatively and gain a new perspective on aata visualization! 

The Top 5 things I am most interested in getting out of the course: 
1. Acquiring the best design practices (color, text, type of visualization, etc) what creating a data visualization to effectively tell a story about the data. 
2. Finding different methods to represent data (not just the traditional bar or pie chart) and determining when it is best to utilize them. 
3. Exploring the capablities and features of Tableau to create data visualizations. 
4. Learning how to identify poor practices/habits of data visualizations and appropriately critique them. 
5. Creating a final project topic about something I am passionate and interested in that highlights the skills and knowledge I have gained from this course that I can someday share with my future employer!

I have always had a interest in the healthcare field and a passion for helping others. Once I graduate, I hope to pursue a career for a federal government agency such as the CDC, FDA, NIH, or HHS as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist working to solve public health and population health problems. Within this career, hopefully, I will have the opportunity to use what I learned in this course to make data visualizations that will truly tell a story!
