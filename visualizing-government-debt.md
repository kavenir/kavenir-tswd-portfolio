# Data Visualization Assignment #1: Visualizing government debt
## Part 1: Working with web-based visualization tools and data
### This visualization represents data from The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) focusing on general government debt-to-GDP ratio in 2014. Within this bar chart, we can also see which countries fall above or below the OECD-Average (bar colored back). It is an interactive visualization where you can click on a bar, and it will display its information (Country, Year, % GDP).

## Part 2: Working with Flourish
### This visualization represents data from The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) focusing on the general government debt-to-GDP ratio between 1995 to 2019. Within this grid of line charts, we can see that generally government debt-to-GDP has increased among most OECD countries from 1995 to 2019. For some countries, data is missing for some years, but using 1995 to 2019 provided the most comparable data. It is an interactive visualization where you can drag your cursor down any line, and it will display the Debt-to-GDP ratio for the associated year.
