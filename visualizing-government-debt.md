# Part 1: Working with web-based visualization tools and data
## This visualization represents data from The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) focusing on general government debt-to-GDP ratio in 2014. Within this visualization, we can also see which countries fall above or below the OECD-Average (bar colored back). It is an interactive visualization where you can click on a bar, and it will display its information (Country, Year, % GDP).
